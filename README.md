Positioning in CSS
==================

**Positioning** is a very critical concept in **CSS**. In order to make complex layouts, it is important to use **position** property of **CSS**. Elements can be positioned using **top**, **bottom**, **left** , **right** properties of **CSS** but before using them it is mandatory to set the **Positioning** property.

There are four types of **Positioning** methods in **CSS**, these are:

**1. Static**

This is the default **Positioning** of any **HTML** element. An element that is **static positioned**, is **positioned** according to the normal flow of the document. **left**, **right**, **top** and **bottom** properties do not work when **position** property of element is set as **static**.

Let's catch hold of this property with the help of this small snippet:

**Note** : You can checkout full working source code from this [link](https://github.com/NamitaMalik/CSS-Position).

**Static.html**
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Positioning Demo</title>
    <style>
        #list1{
            border: thick solid #69b;
            position: relative;
            margin: 70px;
        }
        #head1 {
            border: thin solid #69b;
            position: static;
            left: 20px;
            top: 30px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
<div id="list1">
    <h2 id="head1">List:My position is static.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
        <li>Item 4</li>
        <li>Item 5</li>
    </ul>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

Open **Static.html** file into your favorite browser, you will see output like this:

You might be thinking that, we have applied **left: 20px** and **top: 30px** on heading "head1" but its not working. Yes, you are thinking right! Because In the above code heading "head1" is positioned as **static** and as we have learned before ```**left**, **right**, **top** and **bottom** properties do not work when **position** property of element is set as **static**```, so **left: 20px** and **top: 30px** are not working! "head1" is contained inside a div "list1" which is positioned as **relative**. So what is **relative** **position**? But before moving into that, do remember that an element positioned as static is actually said to be not positioned!

**2. Relative**

We had said above that div "list1" is positioned **relative**. Let us understand what does it exactly it means?

A **relative** element is positioned according to its **normal** or **static** **position**. One can use **top**, **bottom**, **left** and **right** properties to move the element from the **position** where it would normally occur on a **web page**.

Let's see another useful piece of code that would help in making this concept more clear:

**Relative.html**
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Positioning Demo</title>
    <style>
        #list2 {
            border: thick solid #69b;
            position: relative;
            margin: 70px;
        }
        #head2 {
            border: thin solid #69b;
            position: relative;
            top: 20px;
            left: 50px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
<div id="list2">
    <h3 id="head2">List:My position is relative.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
        <li>Item 4</li>
        <li>Item 5</li>
    </ul>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```
**NOTE :** There is only one difference between **Static.html** and **Relative.html** that head/h3 tag has **relative position** while in Static.html its **position** was **static**.

Open **Relative.html** file into your favorite browser, you will see output like this:

![RelativePositioning.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NamitaMalik/CSS-Position/master/images/RelativePositioning.png)

In the above code you must have seen we have used properties **top** and **left**, these have been used to move the element "head2" from its normal **position**.

When you would run the snippets given above in your browser, you would easily feel the difference!

**3. Absolute**

Third in the kitty is **absolute** **Positioning**, this can be a little tricky to understand, but we shall succeed I believe!

An element positioned as **absolute** is positioned **relative** to the first parent element that is not positioned as static. In case there is no positioned ancestor, it positions itself according to the page **body**.

Keep Calm and See the following Code:

**Absolute.html**
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Absolute Positioning Demo</title>
    <style>
        #list3 {
            border: thick solid #69b;
            position: relative;
            margin: 60px;
        }
        #list4 {
            border: thick solid #69b;
            margin: 60px;
        }
        #head3 {
            border: thin solid #69b;
            position: absolute;
            top: 10px;
            left: 100px;
        }
        #head4 {
            border: thin solid #69b;
            position: absolute;
            top: 10px;
            left: 100px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
<div id="list3">
    <h3 id="head3">List: My position is absolute and my ancestor has relative positioning.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
        <li>Item 4</li>
        <li>Item 5</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div id="list4">
    <h3 id="head4">List: My position is absolute but my ancestor doesn't have position.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
        <li>Item 4</li>
        <li>Item 5</li>
    </ul>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

Open **Absolute.html** file into your favorite browser, you will see output like this:

![AbsolutePositioning.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NamitaMalik/CSS-Position/master/images/AbsolutePositioning.png)

After seeing the output, you must be thinking, head element "head3/h3" is inside the div/parent element "list3", but second head element "head4/h4" is not inside. In the above code both "head3" and "head4" are positioned as **absolute**, yet there is difference in their **Positioning**. If we closely look at the above code, "list3" which is the parent element of "head3" is positioned as **relative**, while "list4" which is the parent element of "head4" is not at all positioned, hence there is a huge difference in there **position** on the browser. "head4" uses the **body** of the document to **position** itself.

**Remember : Behaviour would have been same, had "head4" been statically positioned, as static position is actually no position.**

**Caution : Elements which are absolutely positioned can overlap with other elements.**

So to sum up, an absolutely positioned element is positioned **relative** to its parent element.

**4. Fixed position**

**Fixed** **position** means that an element is positioned **relative** to its **browser window** which means that this element won't move even on scrolling. Like elements which are **absolute** positioned, **fixed** positioned elements can also overlap with other elements.

Let's see some live action here:

**Fixed.html**
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Fixed Positioning Demo</title>
    <style>
        #list1, #list2, #list3 {
            border: thick solid #69b;
            position: relative;
            margin: 50px;
        }
        #firsthead {
            border: thin solid #69b;
            position: fixed;
            top: 234px;
            left: 190px;
            background-color: #cdb4c6;
        }
        #head1 {
            border: thin solid #69b;
            position: static;
            top: 20px;
            left: 50px;
        }
        #head2 {
            border: thin solid #69b;
            position: relative;
            top: 12px;
            left: 23px;
        }
        #head3 {
            border: thin solid #69b;
            position: absolute;
            top: 20px;
            left: 100px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
<h2 id="firsthead"> This is a Heading, my position is fixed! I don't move on Scrolling... </h2>
<div id="list1">
    <h2 id="head1">List:My position is static.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
        <li>Item 4</li>
        <li>Item 5</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div id="list2">
    <h3 id="head2">List:My position is relative.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
        <li>Item 4</li>
        <li>Item 5</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div id="list3">
    <h3 id="head3">List:My position is absolute.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
        <li>Item 4</li>
        <li>Item 5</li>
    </ul>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

Open **Fixed.html** file into your favorite browser, you will see output like this:

![FixedPositioning.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NamitaMalik/CSS-Position/master/images/FixedPositioning.png)

You will notice that heading " This is a Heading, my **position** is fixed! I don't move on Scrolling... " will remain there even when you scroll the page.

As you can see in the above code that heading "firsthead" has been positioned **fixed**, therefore even scrolling doesn't takes this heading out of sight!

Well.. in this blog we have seen one of the most critical concepts of **CSS**, however the picture would become clearer only when we use these **Positioning** methods in various situations in order to achieve the desired results.
